# Braille Utils
_Communicating with embossers has never been easier!_

## Summary
BrailleUtils provides a cross platform Java API for embossing and converting braille in PEF-format. Conversion to and from commonly used "braille" text formats is also supported.

The main purpose of Braille Utils is as part of other software, but it comes with a command line user interface for easy access.

## Main Features
  * Emboss PEF-files
  * Validate PEF-files
  * Convert to/from PEF
  * Split/merge PEF-files

## Supported Embossers
The package currently supports a majority of available embossers, including popular <a href="http://www.indexbraille.com/">Index</a> and <a href="http://www.braillo.com/">Braillo</a> embossers. Note that some embossers are untested, because they are unavailable to us.

## About PEF
<a href="http://pef-format.org">PEF</a> is an emerging file format for representing braille books accurately and unambiguously in digital form. Using PEF ensures that the contents of the file is embossed correctly. _No braille knowledge is ever required from the operator_.

PEF has been been awarded with the <a href="http://www.braille21.net/en/programme">Braille21 Award</a>.
